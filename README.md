# Modeling kp for oxidation of superalloy
By [Fan Yang](https://github.com/fanYang-X).

## Background  
In superalloys, oxidation has an erosive effect on the internal microstructure, and the degradation of Î³' strengthened phase caused by oxidation has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of superalloys. Based on machine learning, a prediction model of the relationship between compositions, oxidation and microstructure is constructed to evaluate the oxidation properties of new components and predict the degradation of near-surface microstructure, thus providing guidance for alloy design.
